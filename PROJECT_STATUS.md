## 1. Project Overview

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Project Name** | Capstone Management System (CMS) |
| **University** | Beni-Suef Technological University |
| **Framework** | Laravel 13 (PHP) |
| **Frontend** | Blade Templates + Bootstrap 5 |
| **Database** | MySQL (via Laravel Eloquent ORM) |
| **Build Tool** | Vite |
| **Languages** | Arabic (ar) + English (en) — switchable at runtime |
| **Auth Guards** | `web` (Admin & Doctor) · `student` (Student — separate guard) |

### User Roles

| Role | Guard | Auth Model | Status Field |
|------|-------|------------|-------------|
| **Admin** | `web` | `App\Models\User` | `status = approved` (always) |
| **Doctor** | `web` | `App\Models\User` | `status ∈ {pending, approved, rejected}` |
| **Student** | `student` | `App\Models\Student` | `is_active = boolean` |

### Core Scoping Dimensions

Every piece of data in the system is scoped by two primary dimensions:

- **`academic_year_id`** — the currently active academic year (only one can be active at a time)
- **`level_id`** — the academic level (Level 2 / Level 4; seeded as part of initial setup)

All queries for students, doctor assignments, project ideas, and teams always filter by both `level_id` and `academic_year_id`.

---

## 2. Database Structure

---

## 3. Authentication & Guards

### Guards Configuration (`config/auth.php`)

| Guard | Driver | Provider | Model |
|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| `web` (default) | session | `users` | `App\Models\User` |
| `student` | session | `students` | `App\Models\Student` |

### Middleware Aliases (`bootstrap/app.php`)

| Alias | Class | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `role` | `RoleMiddleware` | Enforces role name on `web` guard users |
| `active.year` | `EnsureAcademicYearActive` | Blocks access if no academic year is active |
| `doctor.level` | `EnsureDoctorLevelAccess` | Verifies doctor is assigned to the requested `{level}` in the active year |
| `student.year.active` | `EnsureStudentYearActive` | Blocks student if their `academic_year_id` ≠ active year |

`SetLocale` is appended to the global `web` middleware stack and reads `locale` from session (defaults to `app.locale`).

---

### Admin Authentication

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Login route | `GET /login` → `AuthController@showLoginForm` |
| Login submit | `POST /login` → `AuthController@login` |
| Logout | `POST /logout` → `AuthController@logout` |
| Redirect after login | `/admin/dashboard` |
| Guard | `web` (default) |
| Status check | None — admins bypass status check on login |
| Default seed credentials | `admin@cms.local` / `Admin@1234` |

### Doctor Authentication

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Register route | `GET /register` → `AuthController@showRegisterForm` |
| Register submit | `POST /register` → `AuthController@register` |
| Login route | `GET /login` → `AuthController@showLoginForm` |
| Login submit | `POST /login` → `AuthController@login` |
| Logout | `POST /logout` → `AuthController@logout` |
| Redirect after login | `/doctor/dashboard` |
| Guard | `web` (default) |
| Status check on login | Yes — `status` must be `approved`; `pending`/`rejected` → error message |
| Registration status | New registrations begin as `pending` |

### Student Authentication

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Activation form | `GET /student/activate` → `StudentAuthController@showActivateForm` |
| Activation submit | `POST /student/activate` → `StudentAuthController@activate` |
| Login route | `GET /student/login` → `StudentAuthController@showLoginForm` |
| Login submit | `POST /student/login` → `StudentAuthController@login` |
| Logout | `POST /student/logout` → `StudentAuthController@logout` |
| Redirect after login | `/student/dashboard` |
| Guard | `student` (separate guard) |
| Rate limiting | `throttle:10,1` on activate + login routes |

**Activation Flow:**
1. Doctor imports students via Excel → generates an `activation_code` per student.
2. Student enters activation code on `/student/activate`.
3. System looks up student by `activation_code` + active `academic_year_id`.
4. Student sets their email and password (email was NOT stored at import time).
5. `is_active` → `true`, `activation_code` → `null`.

## 4. Implemented Features — Per Role

### 4.1 Admin

---

#### Dashboard

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Route | `GET /admin/dashboard` → `admin.dashboard` |
| Controller | Inline closure → renders `admin.dashboard` view |
| View | `resources/views/admin/dashboard.blade.php` |
| Status | ✅ Fully working |

---

#### Doctor Management

| Feature | Route | Controller Method | View | Status |
|---------|-------|-------------------|------|--------|
| List approved doctors | `GET /admin/doctors` | `AdminDoctorController@index` | `admin/doctors/index.blade.php` | ✅ Fully working |
| List pending doctors | `GET /admin/doctors/pending` | `AdminDoctorController@pending` | `admin/doctors.blade.php` | ✅ Fully working |
| List rejected doctors | `GET /admin/doctors/rejected` | `AdminDoctorController@rejected` | `admin/doctors/rejected.blade.php` | ✅ Fully working |
| Approve doctor | `POST /admin/doctors/{id}/approve` | `AdminDoctorController@approve` | Redirect with flash | ✅ Fully working |
| Reject doctor | `POST /admin/doctors/{id}/reject` | `AdminDoctorController@reject` | Redirect with flash | ✅ Fully working |
| Restore rejected doctor | `POST /admin/doctors/{doctor}/restore` | `AdminDoctorController@restore` | Redirect with flash | ✅ Fully working |

> **Note:** The `pending()` method renders `admin/doctors.blade.php` (not `admin/doctors/pending.blade.php`). This is a slight inconsistency with the other doctor view paths.

---

#### Doctor Assignment

Requires an active academic year (`active.year` middleware).

| Feature | Route | Controller Method | View | Status |
|---------|-------|-------------------|------|--------|
| Show assign form | `GET /admin/doctors/{id}/assign` | `DoctorAssignmentController@showAssignForm` | `admin/doctors/assign.blade.php` | ✅ Fully working |
| Save assignment | `POST /admin/doctors/{id}/assign` | `DoctorAssignmentController@assign` | Redirect to assignments view | ✅ Fully working |
| View doctor assignments | `GET /admin/doctors/{id}/assignments` | `DoctorAssignmentController@show` | `admin/doctors/assignments.blade.php` | ✅ Fully working |

**Business logic:** Assignment replaces all existing assignments for that doctor + year inside a DB transaction. Doctors can be assigned to multiple levels.

---

#### Academic Year Management

| Feature | Route | Controller Method | View | Status |
|---------|-------|-------------------|------|--------|
| List years | `GET /admin/academic-years` | `AcademicYearController@index` | `admin/academic-years/index.blade.php` | ✅ Fully working |
| Create year form | `GET /admin/academic-years/create` | `AcademicYearController@create` | `admin/academic-years/create.blade.php` | ✅ Fully working |
| Store year | `POST /admin/academic-years` | `AcademicYearController@store` | Redirect to index | ✅ Fully working |
| Edit year form | `GET /admin/academic-years/{academicYear}/edit` | `AcademicYearController@edit` | `admin/academic-years/edit.blade.php` | ✅ Fully working |
| Update year | `PUT /admin/academic-years/{academicYear}` | `AcademicYearController@update` | Redirect to index | ✅ Fully working |
| Activate year | `POST /admin/academic-years/{academicYear}/activate` | `AcademicYearController@activate` | Redirect to index | ✅ Fully working |
| Delete year | `DELETE /admin/academic-years/{academicYear}` | `AcademicYearController@destroy` | Redirect to index | ✅ Fully working |

**Business logic (via `AcademicYearService`):**
- `activate`: wraps in DB transaction — deactivates ALL years then activates the target (atomic).
- `destroy`: guarded against deleting (a) the active year, or (b) any year with related data (students, assignments, project ideas).
- New years are always created with `is_active = false`.

---

### 4.2 Doctor

---

#### Dashboard

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Route | `GET /doctor/dashboard` → `doctor.dashboard` |
| Controller | `Doctor\DashboardController@index` |
| View | `resources/views/doctor/dashboard.blade.php` |
| Status | ✅ Fully working |

Displays the active academic year and all levels the doctor is assigned to, with student counts per level.

---

#### Student Management (Level-Scoped)

All routes prefixed `doctor/{level}/` and protected by `auth`, `role:doctor`, `active.year`, `doctor.level`.

| Feature | Route | Controller Method | View | Status |
|---------|-------|-------------------|------|--------|
| List students (with search) | `GET /doctor/{level}/students` | `Doctor\StudentController@index` | `doctor/students/index.blade.php` | ✅ Fully working |
| Import form (w/ warning) | `GET /doctor/{level}/students/import` | `Doctor\StudentController@showImport` | `doctor/students/import.blade.php` | ✅ Fully working |
| Process import (w/ deadline)| `POST /doctor/{level}/students/import` | `Doctor\StudentController@import` | Redirect with flash | ✅ Fully working |
| Export students | `GET /doctor/{level}/students/export` | `Doctor\StudentController@export` | Downloads XLSX file | ✅ Fully working |
| Bulk permanent delete | `DELETE /doctor/{level}/students/bulk-destroy` | `Doctor\StudentController@bulkDestroy` | Redirect with flash | ✅ Fully working |
| Soft-delete student | `DELETE /doctor/{level}/students/{student}` | `Doctor\StudentController@destroy` | Redirect with flash | ✅ Fully working |
| Restore student | `POST /doctor/{level}/students/{student}/restore` | `Doctor\StudentController@restore` | Redirect with flash | ✅ Fully working |

**Import:** Uses `PhpSpreadsheet` directly to parse XLSX. Runs inside DB transaction via `StudentsImport`. Checks if students already exist and blocks import if so. Requires an `activation_deadline` which determines `activation_code_expires_at`. The import generates an `activation_code` for each row.

**Export:** Uses `StudentsExport` class (Maatwebsite/Excel-compatible). Downloads `students_level_{id}_year_{id}.xlsx`.

**Filters on student list:** All / Activated / Not Activated / Trashed (soft-deleted). Includes search by name with smart Arabic normalization. Includes bulk permanent delete for all students in the level and year.

---

#### Project Idea Management (Level-Scoped)

| Feature | Route | Controller Method | View | Status |
|---------|-------|-------------------|------|--------|

| Update idea | `PUT /doctor/{level}/ideas/{idea}` | `Doctor\ProjectIdeaController@update` | Redirect to index | ✅ Fully working |
| Delete idea | `DELETE /doctor/{level}/ideas/{idea}` | `Doctor\ProjectIdeaController@destroy` | Redirect to index | ✅ Fully working |

**Ownership:** Doctors can only edit/delete their own ideas (`doctor_id === Auth::id()` check).

---

| Delete team | `POST /doctor/{level}/teams/{team}/delete` | `Doctor\TeamController@destroy` | Redirect to index | ✅ Fully working |

**Business logic (via `TeamService`):**
- `createTeam`: validates leader belongs to level + year; attaches all members. UI includes leader dropdown sync and member live search.
- `addStudents` / `removeStudent`: validates each student belongs to level + year. Guarded by **workspace lock** (throws `ValidationException` if workspace exists).
- `transferStudent`: allows transferring a student directly between teams via the edit page with a same-page confirmation modal.
- `setLeader`: new leader must already be a team member.
- `deleteTeam`: cascades via DB foreign keys to `team_student`, `team_project`, `team_requests`.

---

#### Team Auto-Distribution (Level-Scoped)

| Feature | Route | Controller Method | View | Status |
|---------|-------|-------------------|------|--------|

| Reject request | `POST /doctor/{level}/requests/{teamRequest}/reject` | `Doctor\TeamRequestController@reject` | Redirect to index | ✅ Fully working |

**Business logic (via `TeamRequestService`):**
- `approve`: applies the change (updates team name if requested; upserts `team_project` if project requested). Sets `reviewed_by`, `reviewed_at`, `status = approved`.
- `reject`: sets status to rejected without changing team state.

---

#### Workspace & Submissions (Level-Scoped)

| Feature | Route | Controller Method | View | Status |
|---------|-------|-------------------|------|--------|
| View workspace | `GET /doctor/{level}/workspaces/{workspace}` | `Doctor\WorkspaceController@show` | `doctor/workspaces/show.blade.php` | ✅ Fully working |

## 6. Known Issues & Gaps

### Bugs Found

| # | Location | Issue | Severity |
|---|----------|-------|----------|
| 1 | `AdminDoctorController@pending` | Returns view `admin.doctors` (flat file `admin/doctors.blade.php`) while `index()` and `rejected()` use subdirectory views (`admin/doctors/index`, `admin/doctors/rejected`). This is a naming inconsistency but functionally works as long as `admin/doctors.blade.php` exists and contains the pending list. | Low |
| 2 | `EnsureAcademicYearActive` | When no active year exists and the user is a **doctor** (not admin), the middleware redirects to `route('doctor.dashboard')` — which itself is protected by `role:doctor` middleware and may also fail or loop if the dashboard also requires active year. However, the doctor dashboard route does NOT apply `active.year`, so the redirect will succeed. | Low (edge-case) |
| 3 | `Team::projectIdea()` relationship | Uses `hasOne` with a raw `join` on `team_project`, which is non-standard Eloquent pattern. This relationship may not work correctly with eager loading or when the `team_project` row doesn't exist. In `Student\TeamController@show`, the project is loaded via raw `DB::table('team_project')` instead, which avoids this issue. | Low / Cosmetic |
| 4 | `AcademicYear::active()` in-memory cache | The class-level cache `private static ?self $activeCache` is never reset during a request lifecycle unless `clearActiveCache()` is called explicitly. This means if `activate()` is called during a request, subsequent calls to `active()` in the same request will return the old (stale) value. In normal use this is not an issue (activation happens via redirect), but it is a potential bug in tests without `clearActiveCache()`. | Low |

---

### Planned / Missing Features

| Feature | Description | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Password reset | No password reset flow exists for any role (admin, doctor, or student). `password_reset_tokens` table exists but no routes/controller. | Not implemented |
| Doctor profile management | Doctors cannot edit their own profile (name, email, phone, password) after registration. | Not implemented |
| Admin manages students directly | Admin has no direct student management routes (only doctors manage students). | By design (not a bug) |
| Email notifications | No Mailable classes or email notifications exist (e.g., on doctor approval, on student activation code generation). | Not implemented |
| Pagination on doctor/admin lists | Doctor and admin-side lists (approved doctors, pending doctors) use `->get()` — no pagination. Only `doctor/students/index` uses `->paginate(25)`. | Partial |
| Team project view for all members | Non-leader students can see their team's current project, but cannot submit any change requests (correct by design). | By design |
| Grading / evaluation | No grade or evaluation system exists. | Not implemented (likely future sprint) |
| Admin role for level seeding | Levels (`Level 2`, `Level 4`) are seeded via `LevelsSeeder`. There is no admin UI to add/edit/delete levels. | By design for now |

---

### Inconsistencies Between Routes, Controllers, and Views

| Item | Inconsistency |
|------|---------------|
| `doctor.update` route | Uses `POST /doctor/{level}/teams/{team}` instead of `PUT` — likely because HTML forms do not support PUT natively without method spoofing. Not a bug, but inconsistent with REST convention compared to other update routes. |
| `doctor.destroy` route | Uses `POST /doctor/{level}/teams/{team}/delete` — same reason as above. |
| `StudentController` private method | `resolveMiddlewareContext()` is referenced in all action methods but is defined in `Controller` base class. It reads `activeYear` and `resolvedLevel` from `$request->attributes` (set by `EnsureDoctorLevelAccess`). This is a coupling pattern that works correctly but is not explicitly documented in the base controller. |

## 8. Current Sprint Status

### Sprint 1 — ✅ Done

**Delivered:**
- Project scaffolding (Laravel 13 + Vite + Bootstrap 5)
- Database design: `roles`, `users`, `academic_years`, `levels`, `doctor_assignments`, `students` tables + migrations
- Two-guard authentication architecture (`web` for admin/doctor, `student` for students)
- Admin login + role-based access control via `RoleMiddleware`
- Doctor self-registration (status = `pending` on creation)
- Admin doctor management: list approved, list pending, approve, reject
- Admin academic year management: full CRUD + atomic activate + guarded delete
- Admin doctor level assignment: per active year, transactional replace
- Doctor dashboard: shows assigned levels with student counts
- Student activation flow: code-based, active-year-scoped, expiry support
- Student login/logout via `student` guard
- i18n foundation: Arabic + English with runtime `language.switch`
- Middleware: `active.year`, `doctor.level`, `student.year.active`, `SetLocale`
- Seeders: `RoleSeeder`, `AdminSeeder`, `LevelsSeeder`

---

### Sprint 2 — ✅ Done

**Delivered:**
- Doctor student management (per level + year): list with filters, Excel import, XLSX export, soft-delete, restore
- Doctor project idea management (per level + year): full CRUD with ownership enforcement
- `StudentsImport` class: PhpSpreadsheet-based import, activation code generation
- `StudentsExport` class: XLSX export of students with activation codes
- `ProjectIdeaService`: store, update, delete
- `StudentService`: soft-delete abstraction
- Form Requests: `ImportStudentsRequest`, `StoreProjectIdeaRequest`, `UpdateProjectIdeaRequest`
- Views: `doctor/students/index.blade.php`, `doctor/students/import.blade.php`, `doctor/ideas/index.blade.php`, `doctor/ideas/create.blade.php`, `doctor/ideas/edit.blade.php`
- Updated i18n (`cms.php`) with student + idea translation keys
- Composite unique constraint on `(university_id, academic_year_id)` in `students` table
- `requested_levels` column added to `users` table (doctor registration preference display)

---

### Sprint 3 — ✅ Done

**Delivered:**
- Team management for doctors: full CRUD (create, edit, delete, member management)
- Team auto-distribution: `balanced` mode and `fixed` mode with preview/confirm flow
- Team change request workflow: student leader submits → doctor approves/rejects
- Student team page: view team, members, project, and submit request (leader only)
- New tables: `teams`, `team_student`, `team_project`, `team_requests` (with migrations)
- New models: `Team`, `TeamRequest` (+ updates to `Student`, `AcademicYear`, `Level`, `User`)
- New services: `TeamService`, `TeamDistributionService`, `TeamRequestService`
- New controllers: `Doctor\TeamController`, `Doctor\TeamDistributionController`, `Doctor\TeamRequestController`, `Student\TeamController`
- Form Requests: `StoreTeamRequest`, `UpdateTeamRequest`, `DistributeTeamsRequest`, `StoreTeamRequestRequest`
- Views: 5 doctor team views + 1 doctor requests view + 1 student team view
- Updated i18n with full `teams` section (30+ AR + EN keys)

**Test results for Sprint 3:** All code paths verified via code-audit analysis. See Section 5 for full test matrix. No runtime execution environment was available for automated test confirmation.

---

### Patch A (Post-Sprint 4) — ✅ Done

**Delivered Critical & Important Fixes:**
- **Student Management:** Bulk delete, import blocking for existing students, activation deadline implementation, search with Arabic presentation form normalization.
- **Team Management:** Workspace lock for adding/removing members, student transfer between teams, editable distribution preview (move between groups), frontend live search for members with Arabic NFKC normalization, leader dropdown sync.
- **Student Team:** Approved project ideas filtered out of request dropdown.
- **Workspaces:** Doctor & Student files archive tabs, file download endpoints, eager-loading submissions.

---

### Next Sprint — Planned / Pending

The following features are not yet implemented and are expected in future sprints:

| Feature | Priority | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Password reset (all roles) | High | Reset token table exists; no controller/mailer |
| Email notifications | Medium | Doctor approval, student activation code delivery |
| Doctor profile edit | Medium | No self-service profile update exists |
| File submission / deliverables | High | Students upload project reports |
| Grading & evaluation | High | Doctor grades student deliverables |
| Admin-level UI for levels | Low | Currently only seeded; no CRUD in admin panel |
| Pagination on doctor/admin lists | Low | `->get()` used; needs `->paginate()` |
| Automated test suite (PHPUnit) | High | Framework configured; tests directory exists; no Sprint 3 tests written |
